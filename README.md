# Denoising Autoencoder (DAE)
A simple Pytorch implementation of the denoising autoencoder with swap noise. These self-supervised networks are useful for representation learning to solve downstream tasks.

## To-do
- [ ] Normalization utility functions
- [ ] Encoder baseline model
- [ ] Decoder baseline model
- [ ] Swap Noise dataloader
